# stock-dashboard-csv

This is a simple yet functional stock market dashboard built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Chart.js)** on the frontend and **Flask (Python)** on the backend. It reads historical stock data from local **CSV files** and dynamically displays price charts and key stats like 52-week high/low.


## Problem Statement

The goal of this assignment is to build a functional and responsive stock market dashboard using real or mock stock data. The application should display a list of companies and allow users to view historical stock price charts dynamically. It should support basic backend functionality, data handling, and visualization using a clean frontend interface. The project aims to assess backend/frontend integration, data-driven decision-making, and financial awareness. Bonus features like 52-week high/low and deployment are encouraged to enhance usability and presentation.


## Features

- Responsive, clean UI with sidebar-based company selection
- CSV-based data handling (offline-ready)
- Dynamic chart rendering using Chart.js
- Displays 52-week high & low for selected stock
